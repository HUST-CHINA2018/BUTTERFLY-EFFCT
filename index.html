         <div id="abstract_text"><h2>Azobenzene is a photoresponsive compound which contains two symmetrical benzenes like a pair of butterfly wings. It isomerizes from trans to cis with light switching from the visual to UV, like a butterfly waving its wings, which generates the Butterfly Effect. Once it's inserted between adjacent nucleobases, the tran-to-cis isomerization triggers DNA unwinding as light changes(1). The same magic also applies to derivatives of azobenzene, S-DMAzo(2). Based on their outstanding properties, we design a light-driven nanomachine. The nanomachine consists of a ring as walker and a rod as track.As light of two different wavelengths switches, the doors made of two kinds of photoresponsive DNA strands on the rod open in turns so the ring carrying cargo moves along the track step by step. In a nutshell, this photo-driven nanomachine absolutely prevents the contamination compared with fuel-motivated nanomachines and also provides a new view on oriented molecule transport.</h2></div>

         <div><h3>Molecular machines constructed in vitro consist of a set of discrete molecular components (or supra molecular structures) that respond mechanically to appropriate external stimuli. Traditional molecular machine is usually motivated via the input of chemical energy. Reaction direction changes via adding fuel chains or anti-fuel chains. However, such control method is not ideal. Some disadvantages exists such as low utilization percentage of raw materials and long response time. At the same time, once the number of steps increases, double-strand waste chains will accumulate in the system, which greatly reduces the velocity of subsequent movements, resulting in inevitable chain contamination(1).</h3></div>

  <div id="d1"><h2>1.  Photoresponsive Molecules</h2>
    <div>
          <h3>Azobenzene, with two phenyl rings separated by an azo (–N=N–) bond, is a kind of photoresponsive molecules that convert light energy to mechanical motion through the change of geometry of the molecules .Besides, it can serve as the parent molecule for a broad class of aromatic azo compounds. Azobenzene and its derivative remain the most widely used photoswitches in biological applications. The reasons behind this include their easy synthesis, relatively high photostationary states and quantum yields, fast photoisomerization, and low rate of photobleaching.</h3>
          <h3>Azobenzenes have two stable geometric isomer states: a thermally stable elongated trans configuration, and a meta-stable bent cis form. Remarkably, the azo chromophore can interconvert between these  two isomers upon absorption of just a single photon free from side reactions.Upon absorption of a photon (with a wavelength in the trans absorption band), the azobenzene will convert, with high efficiency, into the cis isomer. Isomerization takes place either through a rotation about the activated N–N single bond, with rupture of the π bond, or through inversion, with a semi-linear and hybridized transition state, where the π-bond remains intact. for the photochemical isomerization, both mechanisms appear viable with a different one dominating depending on the particular chromophore and environment [64]. A second wavelength of light (corresponding to the cis absorption band) can cause the back-conversion. Both these forward and reverse photo-isomerizations typically exhibit by Ultraviolet (310–370 nm) or visible light (λ  greater than 400 nm).</h3>
          <h3>In a new azobenzene derivative,2,6-dimethyl-4-(methylthio)-azobenzene-4′-carboxylic acid (S-DM-Azo), a methylthio group and a carboxylate were incorporated at para positions of the azobenzene scaffold. 59 Usually, push−pull substitution of azobenzene decreases the thermal stability of the cis-form. the methylthio substitution at a para position of azobenzene in conjunction with methylation of both ortho positions allows photo-isomerization with light above 400 nm with sufficient thermal stability of cis-form. And the trans-to-cis and cis-to-trans photoisomerizations of S-DM-Azo were carried out at 400 nm and 450 nm, respectively. </h3>
     </div>
   </div>
    
   <div id="d2"><h2>2.  Photoresponsive DNA</h2>
    <div>
            <h3>A typical azo compound, has a spatial size similar to a nucleobase pair, [3] and the azo group with its polarity lies between two highly hydrophobic benzene rings, just like the polarity distribution in a base pair. So the introduction of azobenzene and its derivative into nucleic acids has been shown to be an ingenious molecular design because the photochromic or photo-switchable nature of azobenzene and its derivative can be used to control the properties of DNA. The planar trans isomer intercalates between adjacent base pairs and stabilizes the duplex through stacking interactions, whereas the nonplanar cis isomer destabilizes the duplex by steric hindrance.</h3>
            <h3>We install an azobenzene or its derivative into a DNA sequence through a D -threoninol scaffold to obtain photoresponsive DNA, which is easily synthesized and allows for multiple introductions of azobenzene or its derivative at any position and in any number via solid-phase synthesis.</h3>
            <h3>The blue one are azo-modified DNA strands, the red one are S-DMazo-modified DNA strands. According to the study (ref 10), after irradiation at 340 nm, the cis-to-trans photoisomerizations of S-DMazo were carried out and trans-Azo isomerizes to the cis form, so 60% of the red bar strands were in the duplex form and the blue strands were dissociated .After irradiation at 390 nm, trans-S-DMazo isomerizes to the cis form and Azo is in the trans form, so 79% of the red bar strands were dissociated and 94% of the blue bar strands were in the duplex form. </h3>

    <div>
            <h3>In DNA origami, a nanostructure is assembled from a very long single-stranded scaffold molecule held in place by many short single-stranded staple oligonucleotides.</h3>
            <h3>As shown in Figure, the DNA origami ring has a shape of a square. the outer length of its sides is 24.75nm(73bp, 1bp=0.34nm), the inner length of its sides is 11.25nm(33bp). And it is about 10.5nm thick. The size makes it move freely on the DNA track. And we attached two kinds of ssDNA to the ring as legs , they can bind to different anchor strands in the DNA track.</h3>

   <div id="d4"><h2>4.  Rod(DNA track)</h2>
    <div>
            <h3>The DNA track is two identical rod connected together. The DNA walker can move at either rod because they are totally no difference. The design help increase the probability of the connection of the walker and the track.</h3>
            <h3>There are four kinds of DNA strands in the DNA track . The two kinds of short strands serve as anchor strands(P1' and P2'); the two kinds of long strands(A1,A1' and A2,A2') that can hybridize serve as doors to limit the movement of the DNA walker, which ensure the orientation of the DNA walker.</h3>
            <img src="images/rod.png"></img>
            <h3>The black nucleobase pairs aid the immobilization of the anchor strands to the rod. The purple nucleobase pairs make the anchor strands long enough to hybridize with the leg strands easily. The red or blue parts are complementary to the legs of the walker.
P1' are Azo-tethered DNAs, P2' are SDMAzo- tethered DNAs. Repetitive regulation of hybridization and dissociation of the DNA duplex (P1&P1' and P2&P2')can be promoted by alternating between irradiation at 340 nm and irradiation at 390 nm.</h3>

   <div id="d5"><h2>5.  Combination</h2>
    <div>
            <h3>The walker and the track are two totally separate objects. First, we need to make the walker get on the DNA track. Due to the steric effecf, it's difficult for the walker to bind to the anchor strands in the track, so we add more anchor strands at the beginning of the track. And to ensure the walker stay at the track, we adapt another kind of door at the very beginning . It is composed of two ssDNA linked to each end of the DNA track and a fuel strand. After successful incubation of the walker and the track, the fuel strand is added to close the door.</h3>

   <div id="d6"><h2>6.  Movement</h2>
    <div>
            <h3>At the very beginning, A1A1' hybridized to close the door and the ring can only bind to P1' anchor. When we illuminate 340nm light, the trans-Azo on P1' isomerizes to the cis form and P1 and P1' dissociates, the ring is free to move on the rod. At this moment, the SDMAzo is trans form, so the leg on the ring can bind to P2' anchor. While A2 and A2' hybridize to prevent the ring to move further. As a result, the walker can move to the next P2' anchor only. When we illuminate 390 nm light, A2 and A2' dissociate to let the ring pass and the ring leaves the P2' anchor to find P1' anchor. Since A1 and A1' combine together, the ring can bind to the exact P1 anchor in the area limited by nearby A1s and A1's. By constantly switching the lighting, the ring will move continuously.</h3>
